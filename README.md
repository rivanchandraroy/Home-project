# Indoor–Outdoor Air Quality Monitoring in  Dhaka

### Understanding Particulate Matter Dynamics Using Low-Cost Sensor Networks at households of Dhaka

---

## 1. Background

Air pollution is one of the most severe environmental and public health challenges of our time, contributing to over **8 million premature deaths** globally each year ([WHO, 2021](#citation)). In rapidly developing urban centers like **Dhaka, Bangladesh**, concentrations of **fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅)**, **Black Carbon (BC)**, and **Ultrafine Particles (UFPs)** often exceed safe limits by several folds, posing severe risks to human health.  

### 1.1 Major Sources of Pollutants
1. Vehicular emissions
2. Cooking activities
3. Smoking & mosquito coils
4. Cleaning and personal care products 
5. Biomass burning  
6. Household combustion activities etc.

Despite the focus on outdoor pollution, **indoor air quality (IAQ)** remains a **neglected dimension** of air pollution research.  
Since people spend nearly **90% of their time indoors**, exposure to indoor pollutants can be even more detrimental particularly in poorly ventilated homes where emissions from **cooking**, **smoking**, and **indoor sources** accumulate.

Moreover, outdoor pollutants infiltrate indoor spaces, creating **complex interactions** that significantly affect total exposure levels.

To address this gap, this project focuses on **continuous monitoring of indoor and outdoor particulate matter** across multiple residential locations in Dhaka using a **low-cost sensor network**.  

Seasonal and diurnal variations are analyzed to provide evidence about pollutant sources and highlight the importance of indoor air quality.

## 2. Our Work and Methodology

### 2.1 Project Overview
A **low-cost air quality monitoring network** was established across **10 residential locations** in Dhaka, equipped with **indoor and outdoor sensors**.
Conducted **continuous monitoring** of **PM₂.₅**, **Black Carbon (BC)**, and **Ultrafine Particles (UFPs)** for **1.5 years** to capture long-term trends.
Performed **data curation and quality control**, including completeness checks, calibration, and outlier removal to ensure reliable datasets.

---

### 2.2 Analytical Approach
Various **statistical analyses** like temporal variation, sesonal comparison and Correlation studies to identify pollution patterns was performed.

Estimated **infiltration factors** to evaluate how outdoor pollutants influence indoor air quality.

---

### 2.3 Computational Tools
Used **Python** and key data science libraries for analysis and visualization:
- `Pandas`  
- `NumPy`  
- `Matplotlib`  
- `SciPy`  
- `Seaborn`

Developed **spatiotemporal models** to understand pollution dynamics across different residential areas.

---

### 2.4 Objective
To provide a **data-driven understanding** of **indoor–outdoor air interactions** and contribute to **sustainable urban air quality management** in Dhaka.
