Air pollution is one of the most severe environmental and public health challenges of our time, contributing to over 8 million premature deaths globally each year (WHO, 2021). In rapidly developing urban centers like Dhaka, Bangladesh, concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅), Black Carbon (BC), and Ultrafine Particles (UFPs) often exceed safe limits by several folds, posing severe risks to human health. These pollutants are primarily generated from vehicular emissions, industrial processes, biomass burning, and household combustion activities.
Despite the focus on outdoor pollution, indoor air quality (IAQ) remains a neglected dimension of air pollution research. Since people spend nearly 90% of their time indoors, exposure to indoor pollutants can be even more detrimental, especially in poorly ventilated homes where emissions from cooking, smoking, and indoor sources accumulate. Moreover, outdoor pollutants infiltrate indoor spaces, creating complex interactions that significantly affect total exposure levels.

To address this gap, this project focuses on continuous monitoring of indoor and outdoor particulate matter across multiple residential locations in Dhaka. Using a low-cost sensor network. Seasonal variation and diurnal variation provide evidence about pollutant sources as well as the significance of indoor air quality.


Our Work and Methodology
•	Established a low-cost air quality monitoring network across 10 residential locations in Dhaka, equipped with indoor and outdoor sensors.
•	Conducted continuous monitoring of PM₂.₅, Black Carbon (BC), and Ultrafine Particles (UFPs) for 1.5 years to capture long-term trends.
•	Performed data curation and quality control, including completeness checks, calibration, and removal of outliers to ensure reliable datasets.
•	Carried out statistical analyses such as temporal variation, seasonal comparison, and correlation studies to identify pollution patterns.
•	Estimated infiltration factors to evaluate how outdoor pollutants influence indoor air quality.
•	Utilized Python programming and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Seaborn for data processing, visualization, and modeling.
•	Developed spatiotemporal models to understand pollution dynamics across different residential areas.
•	Aimed to provide a data-driven understanding of indoor–outdoor air interactions and contribute to sustainable urban air quality management in Dhaka.
